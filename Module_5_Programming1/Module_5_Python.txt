What is Programming
1)What is Python?

Python is a high-level programming language that uses simple English and few lines of code to complete individuals tasks.

2) Explain Data Python Types?

The python data types include integers, floats, and strings. Integers are whole numbers or numbers without decimals such as -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Floats on the other hand are numbers that contain decimals such as 1/3 or sqrt(2). Strings on the other hand are sets of numbers that can be ordered or unordered.

3) What is a function?

A function outside of mathematics is what something does, but in math and computer science, a function is a bridge that connects or relates one set (Input) to another set (Output). Sets are collections of things such as integers, floats, or booleans just to name a few.

4) Explain python’s print statement

Python's print statement is a way for you to print words that are helpful to the user. For example, say I wanted to know when a program finishes running then I could ask my code to print out "I'm done" to indicate that the program has finished running.
