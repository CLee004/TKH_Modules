What is Git and how is it different than Github?
	Git is a software that is used to track changes in a file or set of files. Git is different from Github in that Github is a place where a team can view and edit codes live online.
Why use the terminal?
We use the terminal because as programmers we want to give our commands directly to the computer.
3 benefits of version control
1) We can edit files in real time from the comfort of any terminal we are at.
2) We can delete unnecessary parts of our code
3) We can create copies of the file if we aren’t working on our original terminals
